JS JSON AJAX jQuery sweetalert.js

A small JS challange using of course JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX to read and display JSON file data: users object, with an array of user records (objects).
When user name is selected: a pop-up displays the users name details stored in the JSON file.
For the pop-up I used a little JS lib called sweetalert.js
